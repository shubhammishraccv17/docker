docker run = docker create  + docker start 

 when we execute docker run  we initially execute two commands first one is docker create which takes the initiative to create and setting ups a image environment 
  and second docker start starts the container 
  
  
  hkeeper@hkeeper-swan:~$ sudo docker create hello-world
f89c04454a6ba338b417dff21d0aabde5d377b03c70206ced80490552f5dfac5

f89c04454a6ba338b417dff21d0aabde5d377b03c70206ced80490552f5dfac5 this is just an id of the container that was just created
 
 
 hkeeper@hkeeper-swan:~$ sudo docker start -a f89c04454a6ba338b417dff21d0aabde5d377b03c70206ced80490552f5dfac5

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
