Docker override commands
docker run <image name> command 
here image name indicates the name of image you want to run and command indicate  the coomand you want to execute after image is in running state.

examples 

hkeeper@hkeeper-swan:~$ sudo docker run busybox echo "hi i am shubham"
Unable to find image 'busybox:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/busybox
91f30d776fb2: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:9ddee63a712cea977267342e8750ecbc60d3aab25f04ceacfa795e6fce341793
Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest
hi i am shubham



hkeeper@hkeeper-swan:~$ sudo docker run busybox ls
bin
dev
etc
home
proc
root
sys
tmp
usr
var





Now something to notice 

sudo docker run hello-world  ls
docker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:349: starting container process caused "exec: \"ls\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown.
ERRO[0008] error waiting for container: context canceled 



when  we run ls command with hello-world image we get a error bcoz  in busybox therewas program of ls in the image but not in hello-world hence it doesnt executed
